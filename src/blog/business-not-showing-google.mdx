## The Frustration of Invisible Businesses

You've invested in your business. You've perfected your service. But when customers search Google, your business simply doesn't appear. This invisibility translates directly to lost revenue.

If your business isn't showing up on Google, you're not alone—and this problem is almost always fixable.

## Issue #1: Your Google Business Profile Is Incomplete or Unverified

Google Business Profile (GBP) is the foundation of local visibility.

### The fix:
1. Claim and verify your listing at business.google.com
2. Complete every single field
3. Add high-quality photos
4. Select accurate categories
5. Write a keyword-optimized description

## Issue #2: Your NAP Information Is Inconsistent

NAP stands for Name, Address, and Phone number. Google checks hundreds of directories to verify your information.

### The fix:
1. Audit your current NAP across the web
2. Fix incorrect listings
3. Remove duplicate listings
4. Ensure consistency on your own website
5. Build new citations on quality directories

## Issue #3: Your Website Lacks Local Signals

Google determines local relevance partly through signals on your website.

### The fix:
1. Add your city/region to page titles
2. Include address and phone number in header/footer
3. Create location-specific landing pages
4. Add Schema markup
5. Embed Google Maps on your contact page

## Issue #4: You Have Too Few Reviews

Reviews are a powerful ranking signal and influence click-through rates.

### The fix:
1. Implement a review request system
2. Make leaving a review easy
3. Respond to every review
4. Address negative feedback professionally
5. Encourage detailed reviews

## Issue #5: Your Primary Category Is Wrong

Your primary category tells Google what type of business you are.

### The fix:
1. Research your category by searching for your service
2. Choose the most specific accurate category
3. Add secondary categories for additional services
4. Avoid keyword-stuffing in category names

## Issue #6: Your Website Isn't Mobile-Friendly

Over 60% of local searches happen on mobile devices.

### The fix:
1. Use responsive design
2. Ensure tap targets are large enough
3. Optimize images for fast loading
4. Improve page speed (aim for under 3 seconds)

## The Path Forward: Diagnose and Fix

Start by checking your Google Business Profile for completeness. Then audit your NAP consistency across the web. Assess your website's local signals and content.

Most businesses will see improvement within 2-3 months of implementing these fixes.
